# MySQL with Python
To run the code, clone the repo and install mysql-connector-python. The program should be ready to run.

In this version, simple mysql commands are used.

Firstly, the connection between the mysql server and the python is created using sql.connect().

Then, the CREATE DATABASE *name is used to create a database in the server.
The SHOW DATABASES command followed by a for loop to view the databases is shown.

Finally, the DROP DATABASE command is used to delete the previously created database.
